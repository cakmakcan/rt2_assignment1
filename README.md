# Scene in Coppelia environment:

The file: **RT2ASS1.ttt**  contains a scene in the Coppelliasim simulator environment for ROS.

This communication with the robot in the simulator is let thanks a pubisher to the /odom topic , that is declared in the LUA script of the robot, the same topic is subscribed by the go_to_point node, in this way the two nodes communicate between each other. Moreover there is also a subscriber to /cmd_vel topic that receive the messages from the go_to_point publisher to the same topic.
